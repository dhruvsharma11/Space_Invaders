Space Invaders Game
Dhruv Sharma

Classic Space Invaders Minigame that I created to fullfil my interest in game development.
Uses the Pygame library to creating moving aliens that need to be shot by a spaceship. The user loses when the aliens reach the same row as the spaceship.

I will continue to optimize this program by making it object oriented and easy to read.
